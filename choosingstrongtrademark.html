<h3 class="second-title">Designing a Strong Trademark</h3>

<p>One fo the most important decisions in your business may be designing a trademark to identify your brand to your
    customers.
    If you intend to register your mark with he United States Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) in order to get federal
    protection, you must consider the design of your trademark carefully so that the PTO does not reject it.</p>

<p>A mark is considered strong when it is not likely to be confused with another's trademark, making it easier to
    protect against infringement The strongest marks fall into the category of either fanciful or arbitrary marks. The
    other categories are suggestive, descriptive and generic. You do not want your mark to ve categorized as descriptive
    or generic by the PTO because they have a highter probability of not veing registrable.</p>

<!-- underline -->
<p>Generic marks</p>

<p>A generic mark will fail registration because it is considered teh weakest. SWhen everyone has the right to use the
    work in your mark because it is commonly used as names for goods or services, it cannot be protected. For example, a
    mark the PTO would not register because it was considered generic would be if you wanted to trademark the work
    "car" because you sold cars or "bicycles" as a mark to identify your retail bicycle store.</p>

<p>People may want to use generic words to identify their company because there is a built-in recognition with those
    common words, and you may adopt a generic word mark as long as you are aware that you cannot prevent others from
    using it to identify a competing product or service.</p>

<!-- may be typo in original copy. in first sentence "as generic if it the word" -->
<p>Even strong trademarks can become categorized as generic if it the word become commonly used in non-trademark uses
    over time, or if the owner of the mark fails to use it s mark properly or fails to protect its mark against
    infringers. Strong marks that eventually become generic due to long-term and widespread non-trademark use include
    ESCALATOR, ZIPPER and ASPIRIN.</p>

<!-- underline -->
<p>Descriptive marks</p>

<p>Descriptive marks are more difficult to register than fanciful or arbitrary marks. They are words or designs that
    describe goods and/or services. A descriptive mark is less likely to be registered by the PTO until it has acquired
    distinctiveness, which is generally shown by use in commerce over five years. Examples of descriptive markds
    include CREAMY to describe yogurt, and WORLD'S BEST BAGELS to describe bagels.</p>

<p>If the PTO does register a descriptive mark, it may be harder to protect against others who use identical or similar
    marks because descriptive marks may have weaker trademark rights. The costs of policing infringing use fo a
    descriptive mark, and enforcing your rights to exclusive use of such a mark, may end up costing your company mre
    money in the long run. People may take that risk because descriptive marks may require less marketing to educate or
    advertise to consumers who may immediately be able to identify your product or service from your descriptive
    mark.</p>

<!-- underline -->
<p>Fanciful or Arbitrary marks</p>

<p>Strong marks that are easiest to legally protect against infringers and to register with he PTO are fanciful and
    arbitrary marks. Fanciful marks consist of words you have invented, and arbitrary marks are actual words with a
    known meaning buy no association with the goods or services.</p>

<p>Fanciful workds are invented for the sole purpose of being a trademark such as EXXON, KODAK and XEROX. A fanciful
    mark can also be JELIKAO to describe a beauty salon or BELLMINCO for a tax agency.</p>

<p>Arbitrary marks means you have taken a known word that has no logical or common association with your goods or
    services, but then y ou use that word to create an identifiable relationship with your goods or services. For
    example, an arbitrary mark can be BANANAS to identify tires, APPLE for computers, and LOTUS for software.</p>

<!-- underline -->
<p>Suggestive marks</p>

<p>Suggestive marks do what its name says - suggest a connection to the goods or services. These are also considered
    strong marks because the word is being used in a creative or unusual way, and requires consumers to make an
    imaginable lap to connect your mark to your good or service. For example, MICROSOFT is a suggestive of software for
    computers, MUSTANG is suggestive of a fast car, and PLAYBOY for a men's magazine.</p>

<p>If others are less likely to use common words to make such common words to make such connections to your product or
    service, there are likely no pre-existing suggestive marks that have been registered and you have stronger trademark
    rights to assert against others who may later make infringing use of your suggestive word mark.</p>
