<h3 class="second-title">Designing a Strong Trademark</h3>

<p>One fo the most important decisions in your business may be designing a trademark to identify your brand to your
    customers.
    If you intend to register your mark with he United States Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) in order to get federal
    protection, you must consider the design of your trademark carefully so that the PTO does not reject it.</p>

<p>A mark is considered strong when it is not likely to be confused with another's trademark, making it easier to
    protect against infringement The strongest marks fall into the category of either fanciful or arbitrary marks. The
    other categories are suggestive, descriptive and generic. You do not want your mark to ve categorized as descriptive
    or generic by the PTO because they have a highter probability of not veing registrable.</p>

<!-- underline -->
<p>Generic marks</p>

<p>A generic mark will fail registration because it is considered teh weakest. SWhen everyone has the right to use the
    work in your mark because it is commonly used as names for goods or services, it cannot be protected. For example, a
    mark the PTO would not register because it was considered generic would be if you wanted to trademark the work
    "car" because you sold cars or "bicycles" as a mark to identify your retail bicycle store.</p>

<p>People may want to use generic words to identify their company because there is a built-in recognition with those
    common words, and you may adopt a generic word mark as long as you are aware that you cannot prevent others from
    using it to identify a competing product or service.</p>

<!-- may be typo in original copy. in first sentence "as generic if it the word" -->
<p>Even strong trademarks can become categorized as generic if it the word become commonly used in non-trademark uses
    over time, or if the owner of the mark fails to use it s mark properly or fails to protect its mark against
    infringers. Strong marks that eventually become generic due to long-term and widespread non-trademark use include
    ESCALATOR, ZIPPER and ASPIRIN.</p>
