<h3 class="second-title">Trademark - Likelihood of Confusion</h3>

<p>Not all trademarks receive the same level of protection due to their categorization (fanciful, arbitrary, suggestive,
    descriptive or generic), but also due to a concept known as 'likelihood of confusion'.</p>

<p>The key to proving trademark infringement is when another company is using your mark in a way that will likely cause
    confusion. First, the infringing trademark must be used. Second, it must ve in commerce. Third, and key to any
    infringement claim, is that the use of the mark is commerce is causing a likelihood of confusion.</p>

<p>Likelihood of confusion results when your mark and another company's mark can be mistakenly believed as coming from
    the same source. In other words, consumers would likely assume that one company was providing the service or product
    associated with that mark.</p>

<p>A strong mark has less likelihood of being confused with the mark form another company because it is so recognizable
    that it greatly distinguishes your goods or services. For example, a computer that had the logo of an apple with a
    bite in it would be recognized as an Apple computer. If another company X put a similar design to the Apple logo on
    its computers, likely confusing consumers into thinking they were getting a computer directly from Apple, then
    company X would be infringing on Apple's trademark through likelihood of confusion.</p>

<p>Each state has different factors to prove likelihood of confusion. In California, the factors include the following:
    (1) strength or weakness of the original mark, (2) use of the infringing mark on the same or related products, (3)
    similarity of the original mark to the infringing mark, (4) actual confusion by consumers, (5) knowing use of a mark
    to piggyback off the reputation and good will of the original mark, (6) if the infringing mark is advertised or sold
    in similar ways, and (7) the sophistication of the consumer in their ability to distinguish between the original
    mark
    vs. the infringing mark.</p>

<p>If the products are not the same, the court will also consider who likely the company holding the original trademark
    may expand into tselling the same product. If so, then there is a greater likelihood that the court will find that
    there is confusion. The court may also consider other factors that are relevant to each particular case.</p>

<p>These factors are meant to be a guideline for the court to determine the probability of confusion. Depending on the
    facts of each particular case the presence or absence of a factor does not necessarily have particular weight in
    determining whether a strong likelihood of confusion exists. Since the court is not required to consider every
    factor, the assistance of an attorney in focusing on the factors that support you and defending against the factors
    that undermine your case is important.</p>

<p>An infringer may use the defense of fair use, collateral use for parody. Fair use allows another to sue the original
    mark for descriptive and identification purposes because no consumer confusion actually occurs. For example,
    newspapers can make use of the trademarked names of companies, entertainment groups and sports teams to reference
    them for a story - such use of another's original mark will not be considered infringement because the newspaper can
    use the defense of nominative fair use.</p>

<p>Collateral use allows antoher to use a trademarked item as part of their product, allowing another company to use the
    item's trademark mark to identify its presence in the overall product. Parody is also a defense, as part of the
    protections of the First Amendment, because a parody of an original mark can have artistic, editorial, or satirical
    value.</p>

<p>A finding of likelihood of confusion rests on many factors, and if successful, then the owner of the original mark can
    be awarded an injunction against further use of the infringing mark and money damages. Any threat of litigation is
    a serious matter, and the costs of protecting a trademark against infringement can be steep. However, that is the
    unfortunate reality of doing business today.</p>

<p>If you have more questions, consult an attorney. Remember, planning is the first step in preparing for your
    future.</p>
