<h3 style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">Simple Probate</h3>

<p>Probate can be a cost in time and money. When you pass away, your will has to be submitted to a court to get
    permission or approval to transfer the title of your assets and property to your beneficiaries.</p>

<p>But if you have an estate less than $150,000 in gross value, then your executor may avoid the time and expense of a
    formal probate by filing an affidavit to transfer only your personal property 40 days after you pass away. For real property valued
    at less than $50,000, your executor can file an affidavit at least 6 months after you pass away, thus avoiding formal probate.</p>

<p>Assets included in the $150,000 limit to be considered a small estate include all your personal and real property, including all life insurance
    or retirement and benefits paid to the estate. Do not include property that are structured bypass probate such as
    assets in a living trust or life insurance that pass directly to your beneficiary.</p>

<p>Another simplified procedure to distribute your assets can be filed by a surviving spouse using the "Spousal Property
    Petition." A spouse or your minor children can also file a "Set-Aside Petition" to avoid a formal probate if the net value of
    your real and personal property is less than $20,000 by filing an affidavit with the court.</p>

<p>If you have more questions, <b>consult</b> an attorney. Remember, <b>planning</b> is the first step in preparing for
    your future.</p>
