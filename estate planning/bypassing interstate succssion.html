<h3 class="second-title">Bypassing Intestate Succession</h3>

<p>What if you don't want to set up a will or living trust? That means any property in your estate will likely be
    subject
    to intestate succession - where the state determines who gets your assets instead of you choosing who gets to
    inherit.</p>

<p>If you don't want to leave the decision up to the state, then you can structure your assets so you don't give up the
    power to choose who inherits.</p>

<p>If you structure your estate properly, some of your assets will not be affected by intestate succession laws. You can
    also take assets out of your estate by giving them as gifts.</p>

<p>Or you can use certain vehicles to bypass the probate process. Probate is getting court permission to legally
    transfer title of your assets to your heirs. If you put your assets in certain vehicles, then those assets don't have to be
    named in a will or be probated</p>

<img class='document' src="images/document.png" alt="document">
<p class="document">That's because you've already determined who inherits those assets. The following are some ways to bypass intestate
    succession: </p>
</div>

<ol>
    <li>Putting your assets in a <b>living trust</b> to avoid probate. After you pass away, your trustee will ensure
        that those assets are transferred to your beneficiaries.
    </li>
    <li>Titling your property as <b>joint tenants with right to survivorship</b>, or characterizing it as community
        property. That means title is automatically transferred without needing court permission in probate.
    </li>
    <li><b>Life insurance</b>.  Your named beneficiary receives the insurance proceeds directly within 30 to 60 days after
    you pass away.  As the legal owner of the insurance payout, probate is avoided because there is no need to determine title to those funds
    </li>
        <ol type="a">
            <li>Other things to be aware of: Your named beneficiary must be alive at the time of inheritance.</li>
            <li>If you name beneficiaries for other assets such as your <b>IRAs, 401ks or annuities</b>, then probate is also avoided.</li>
            <li>If you name your estate as your beneficiary, then those proceeds will be have to be probatedin court because the title
            of the money has to be legally transferred to your heirs.</li>
        </ol>
    <li><b>Payable-on-death bank accounts</b>.  Any money in a bank account will be owned by your named beneficiary upon death
    of the account owner.</li>
    <li><b>Transfer-on-death registration</b> for vehicles.  In California, you can name a beneficiary directly on the certificate of registration, avoiding probate.</li>
    <li>Securities in <b>transfer-on-death accounts</b>. This is like a payable-on-death bank account. Upon your death, a transfer
    agent will transfer ownership of your stocks, bonds or other brokerage account, again avoiding the probate process.</li>
</ol>

<p>When you set up these vehicles, make sure it doesn't contradict your estate plan.  For example, if you intend to divide
your estate equally between your children, be sure you're not naming only one child on an account because that child is under no legal obligation
to give any money to your other children. If he/she does honor your wishes, then it is a taxable gift.</p>

<img class='document' src="images/magnifyingglass.png" alt="magnifying glass magnifying the word tax">

 <p class="document">Make sure to leave enough assets in your estate to pay your debts, taxes and other expenses.  And in setting up these vehicles, be
 careful not to mistakenly forget to give something to a child or grandchild, resulting in an awkward situation for your named beneficiaries.</p>

<p>You can structure your assets so that you may not need a will or trust, but that takes a lot of coordination and planning to avoid probate.
If you have more questions, consult an attorney.  Remember, planning is the first step in preparing for your future.</p>
