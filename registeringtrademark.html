<h3 class="second-title">Registering Your Trademark</h3>

<p>With research and diligence, you acn file a trademark yourself using the Trademark Electronic Application System
    (TEAS). You can file the regular TEAS application or the TEAS Plus application on the Internet rather than filing a
    paper application></p>

<p>An Internet filing has advantages over a paper application with lower fling fees, more accuracy because information
    you enter in a database is transferred directly to the online application, validation check so you don't omit
    necessary information, and 24-hour availability to file and make credit card payments.</p>

<p>The TEAS application costs $325 per class of goods or services, while the TEAS Plus costs $275 per class because you
    must meet certain reqirements to qualify to file the application such as only communication through e-mail and must
    be able to identfy yhour goods/services from a list provided by the United States Patent and Trademark Office
    (USPTO). The paper application costs $375 per class.</p>

<!-- underline -->
<p>The information needed for the application include (to be part of the public record):
    <ol>
        <li>The application must be filed by the owner of the trademark;</li>
        <br>
        <li>Name and street address of the applicant. Recommended to provide e-mail. NOTE: If you are an applicant who does
            not live in the United States you need to provide the name and address of your representative living in the
            U.S.;
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Clear image of the trademark, as depicted in a drawing that is either a 'standard character' or a 'special
            form';
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>List the specific goods or services that you will use in conjunction with your trademark</li>
        <br>
        <li>Submit the application filing fees for each class. Goods and services are sorted in to classes. Each class
            requires a separate fee. NOTE: General class headings are not the same as accurately identifying the goods or
            services to be listed in your application
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>State your basis for filing: "use in commerce" or "intent to use"</li>
        <br>
        <li>Provide an acceptable, proper specimen for each class (sample of your trademark on your goods or services as
            used in commerce that is not likely to be perceived as ornamental or decorative rather than a trademark)
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Sign the application - either by the owner of trademark if filing as an individual, someone with legal
            authority to sign on behalf of the owner if a business entity, or an attorney
        </li>
    </ol>
</p>

<p>If you fail to correctly olist the goods or services, or get rejected by the USPTO, your fees will not be refunded.
    If the USPTO list does not accurately describe your goods or services, you must create your own identification in
    clear, accurate, and concise terms.</p>

<p>Filing an application by selecting a description that closely describes your goods or services, but is not accurate,
    may void your application. Your fee will not be refunded, but rather you will have to file a new application and
    pay the filing fee again.</p>

<p>Please note that if you design variations on your mark, then each variation requires its own separate USPTO
    application and fee.</p>

<p>After you file your application, you must check t he status of your pending application through the Trademark Staus
    and Document Retrieval system, and respond to any action or notice within the appropriate time frame.</p>

<p>The registration process may take 6 months to 1 year. Below is a time line with approximate time frames for an
    application based on a trademark's use in commerce</p>
