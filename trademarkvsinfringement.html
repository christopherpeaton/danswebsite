<h3 class="second-title">Trademark Fair Use vs. Infringement/Dilution</h3>

<p>Trademark infringement occurs when others use the same or similar infringing trademark as your original mark that
    results in consumer confusion in commerce. If you have built up a name for your company's mark, others may try to
    piggyback off the goodwill. brand name and reputation you have spent time and money into building into your
    mark.</p>

<p>Confusion is when a trademark is used in a way that will likely cause confusion that the product/services of
    different companies come from the same source, resulting in unfair competition. Sometimes, a company will
    deliberately use a similar infringing trademark to deceive consumers into thinking they are buying your product from
    your company. This is unfair competition, violating the law when another uses/advertises your mark or a similar mark
    in ways deemed unfair, deceptive, untrue, fraudulent or misleading.</p>

<p>Unauthorized use of another company's trademark may result in liability (injunction and money damages) unless you
    have a defense. A common defense, if applicable, to trademark infringement is the doctrine of fair use. Nominative
    fair use applies to situations when a mark is used as a reference or comparison to the mark owner's product.</p>

<p>Despite owning a mark and having the legal right to being the only one to use your mark, the doctrine of fair use
    allows others to use your mark in limited ways. for example, another may make fair use of your mark to make product
    references, surveys, resale of your products, or comparative advertising.</p>

<p>Fair use means using another's trademark in other ways than as a mark to identify products/services, and the use must
    bve limited to a description. That means that having a trademark cannot prevent others from exercising their right
    to use words or images in their primary descriptive sense.</p>

<p>The owner's monopoly of a word or phrase does not withdraw it form everyday language use, or make it the exclusive
    possession of the mark's owner. For example, Apple cannot prevent others from using the word apple to describe the
    fruit, and Jaguar cannot prevent people from using the word jaguar to describe the animal. Newspapers can also refer
    to the mark Apple and Jaguar to reference these companies because the papers are not implying endorsement by the
    mark owners, or trying to deceive the consumers to believe Apple or Jaguar publish or sponsor their papers.</p>

<p>Regardless of fair use, some companies are zealous in protecting their mark against any and all unauthorized use.
    Thus, if you do use another's mark without express authourization, then you may receive a cease and desist letter or
    have an infringement suit filed against you. Please consult an attorney if you have received such a letter to assist
    you in understanding your rights and defenses.</p>

<p>Trademark dilution is another infringement claim, and applies to the unauthorized use of famous marks where the
    infringed use may lessen the uniqueness or distinctiveness of the famous mark. A claim of dilution can be made
    against unauthorized use on products that are not related or do not compete with products connected with the
    original mark. If the mark is not famous, a claim of dilution must prove likelihood of confusion when the marks are
    substantially similar.</p>

<p>The success of an infringement claim depends on proving confusion, deception or mistake in the average consumer about
    the source of the trademarked goods or services. But fair use can be used as a defense to allow another to make use
    of another's mark in limited ways that include for teaching, research, news reporting, criticism and comment.</p>

<p>According to Judge Kozinski, "Trademarks are part of our common language, and we all have some right to use them to
    communicate in truthful, non-misleading ways." <i>Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A., Inc. v. Tabari.</i> 610 F.3d 1171 (9th
    Cir. 2010)</p>

<p>If you have more questions, consult an attorney. Remember, planning is the first step in preparing for your
    future.</p>
