<p>Copyright law protects original works the moment it is created. Examples of original works that can be protected
    include anything that falls under the category of literary, dramatic, musical or artistic works (i.e., poetry,
    novels, movies, songs, computer software, architecture, photographs).</p>

<p>Not protected under copyright are ideas and inventions. Patents protect discoveries or inventions while copyright
    protects your work when it is fixed in a tangible form that can be perceived directly or with the help of a
    machine/device.</p>

<p>If you express an idea in written form, copyright will protect your written description of your idea, but not the idea
    itself. That means if someone else also writes down the idea in his or her own words, that is allowed and you cannot
    claim copyright infringement. Copyright also does not protect names, titles, slogans, or short phrases - which may
    be protected under trademark law.</p>

<p>Copyright is automatically given to original works the moment they are created. However, some owners may choose to
    register their work with the Copyright Office. To register a work, you complete an application form and submit a
    copy of your work that will not be returned. Applications on paper cost $85. there are also optional services
    related to registration that require a separate fee such as recordation, searches, copying or special handling for
    qualified claims.</p>

<p>If you want to protect your domain name, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) manages the
    assignment of domain names through accredited registers. Protection of your domain name does not fall within
    copyright law, but is rather administered by the nonprofit ICANN organization.</p>

<p>If you choose to register your work with the Copyright Office, you will get a certificate of registration and can
    immediately bring a lawsuit against infringers. If you have not registered, you must do so first before you can file
    an infringement claim in a court of law. In addition, the United States has copyright agreements with most countries
    so your registration will likely be protected to some extent in other countries.</p>

<p>You may copyright a work you have not personally created only if you have the rights to that work. You are considered
    the owner of a work if you have legal rights to it by either creating it yourself, inheriting the work from the
    author, or was assigned the rights to the work by contract</p>

<p>Please consult an attorney if you have questions about the process of copyright registration, or if your work can be
    protected under copyright, trademark or patent law.</p>
<p>Remember, planning is the first step in preparing for your future.</p>
