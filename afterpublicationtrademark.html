<h3 class="second-title">What Happens After Your Trademark is Published?</h3>

<p>Congratulations if you have registered your trademark with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO)!
    That means you have passed the examining attorney's review of your application and your trademark meets federal law
    and any additional requirements issued by the USPTO attorney.</p>

<p>Once the USPTO publishes your approved trademark in its weekly online publication, the Official Gazette, you must
    wait an additional 30-days to allow the public to object to your trademark. If anyone objects to your trademark,
    they must file an opposition with the USPTO administrative tribunal, which is similar to a court proceeding and
    heard before the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board.</p>

<p>If there is no opposition that will delay the completion of your trademark registration, then you will receive an
    official registration certificate about 11 weeks after your mark is published in the Official Gazette for a
    "use-in-commerce"
    application. If you filed an "intent-to-use" application, you will receive a notice of allowance that your mark is
    approved about 8 weeks
    after publication, but mist take additional steps to ensure your trademark is officially registered.</p>


<p>After your trademark has been registered, you have to take steps to maintain your rights in the mark. Between the
    5<sup>th</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup>
    year after the registration, you must file your first maintenance document. The USPTO will not send out reminders so
    you must remember to file your declaration of continued use. If you file nothing by the end of your 6<sup>th</sup>
    year, your
    trademark registration will be cancelled. That means you'll have to file a new application because your registration
    will be
    reinstated by the USPTO.</p>

<p>At the end of every 10-year period after registration, you must file additional documents to maintain your trademark.
    If you do not do so, your trademark will either be cancelled or the USPTO will allow your registration to
    expire.</p>

<p>During the period of registration of your trademark with the USPTO, you are required to police and enforce your
    rights.
    Basically if you don't use it or protect it, you will lose the exclusive rights to your trademark.</p>

<p>Being vigilant does not take a lot of effort, and should be considered a necessary cost to doing business when you
    have invested so much
    time and money in building your brand through your trademark.</p>

<p>If you have any questions about protecting or maintaining your trademark, please consult an attorney.
    Remember, planning is the first step in preparing for your future.</p>
