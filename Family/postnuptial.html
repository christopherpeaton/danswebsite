<h3 class="second-title">What is a Postnuptial Agreement</h3>

<p class="postnuptual">When you marry an individual, you are agreeing to honor the highest level of fiduciary duty in
    addition to promising to love and care for each other. Though we all hope for a forever, where we live happily ever
    after, one day that may change and we part ways to stop being unhappy together.</p>

<p class="postnuptual">A postnuptial agreement can assist a couple in this difficult time by predetermining who gets
    what. A postnuptial agreement can redefine community or separate property by specifying (in advance) the character
    of the property already owned or to be acquired.</p>


<p style="clear: left;" class="postnuptual">A postnuptial is more difficult to uphold in court than a prenuptial because
    a married couple has a fiduciary duty to care for one another in all ways. Changing the character of property during
    marriage can raise a presumption of invalidity if one spouse is disadvantaged so it is imperative that the
    "disadvantaged" spouse fully understand the terms of the postnuptial and voluntarily agree to sign it.</p>

<p class="postnuptual">A postnuptial will be invalidated if a spouse signs the agreement under fraud, duress, undue
    influence, or does not have legal capacity. However, many people make postnuptial agreements that hold up in court,
    if properly drafted and maintained. Each spouse should take the agreement to his or her attorney for review to
    ensure full and complete understanding of the terms.</p>

<p class="postnuptual">To ensure a prenuptial is not invalidated, ensure that all tangible and intangible items are
    listed (i.e., personal belongings, special family heirlooms, financial assets, business interests that may include
    intellectual properties and goodwill). If an item is forgotten, it could be troublesome later on. Lists are helpful
    in generating a discussion and ensure that all items were included.</p>

<p style="clear: left;" class="postnuptual">A postnupial should be drafted with your overall estate plan as context. If
    you have children from a prior marriage, and want to provide for any children resulting from your current marriage,
    your will or living trust should be updated to consider what you have agreed to be your community or separate
    property in the postnuptial.</p>

<p class="postnuptual">Please note that a California postnuptial agreement cannot control child custody, child support,
    control a spouse's
    behavior such as punishing unfaithfulness, and cannot regulate the practice of religion.</p>

<p class="postnuptual">Negotiating a postnuptial agreement can be a sensitive and complicated matter. Be sure to
    <em>consult</em> an attorney for assistance if you need help or have any questions. Remember, planning is the first
    set in preparing for our future.</p>
