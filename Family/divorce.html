<h3 class="second-title">What Happens After You File For Divorce?</h3>

<p>Marriage is an institution. Unfortunately, not very institution is created on strong foundations. When a divorce
    happens, it is sad when two people have to disengage their lives from each other.</p>

<p>In California, spouses can file for divorce based either on irreconcilable differences or incurable insanity. Not
    surprisingly, incurable insanity is rarely used as a ground for divorce because medical proof of insanity is
    required. Since California became a 'no fault' divorce state, neither spouse has to prove the other spouse did
    something wrong in order to file for a divorce. Rather, all you have to do is check the irreconcilable difference
    checkbox to indicate that you no longer get along.</p>

<p>To file paperwork in California, you must be a California resident for 6 months. After you file and serve the
    paperwork to your spouse, he or she has 30 days to answer it. Then California has a mandatory 6-month waiting period
    before a judge will make your divorce official by signing the divorce decree.</p>

<p>Aside from the emotional fallout, there is the financial disentanglement that must occur. So the question of who gets
    what must be sorted out. If you have a prenuptial or post nuptial agreement, then the division of property may
    already be decided. If you have not decided how to divide your property yet, you can use the time during the 6-month
    waiting period to engage in such negotiations.</p>

<p>If you do not have a prior agreement, the division of property depends on the categorization of your assets as
    community or separate. Community property is all real or personal property, no matter where it is located, acquired
    during marriage. Separate property is what is owned by each spouse before marriage, or acquired by gift or
    inheritance during marriage.</p>

<p>If you are legally separated, then anything you acquire after the separation is considered separate property. Upon
    divorce, any asset characterize as separate property is not divided between spouses. That is because your spouse
    never had any interest in your separate property.</p>

<p>Only assets and debts axquired during marriage and characterized as community property need to be divided between
    spouses. That means both spouses have a 50/50 interest in all community property, assets and debts, unless otherwise
    agreed upon, no matter who worked, earned or acquired the assets or debts.</p>

<p>In any dispute of whether an asset is community or separate property, the funds used to acquire the asset needs to be
    traced. If the funds used to buy the asset came from community property, then the asset is community property owned
    50/50 by both spouses.</p>

<p>In the event that community funds were commingled with separate property funds, that does not necessarily mean that
    the separate property funds transform into community property. To prove otherwise, the separate property portion of
    any commingled funds must be traced back to a spouse's separate property. The burden is on the spuse claiming an
    asset is separate property to prove it is actually separate.</p>

<p>If property is put into joint title, then tracing cannot be used. The courts will presume that real property put into
    joint title is community property unless there is a clear written agreement or statement that it is not. However,
    tracing can be used to prove money in a joint bank account is separate property.</p>

<p>Divorce and the subsequent division of property between spouses can be a tricky negotiation. If you need assistance,
    please consult a family law attorney. Remember, planning is the first step in preparing for your future.</p>
