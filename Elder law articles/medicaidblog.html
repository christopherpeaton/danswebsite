<p>Medi-Cal is the Califorina Medical Assistance Program. Medicaid is called Medi-Cal in California. It is a state
    program
    that will provide health coverage to qualified, low-income California residents and seniors.
</p>

<p><span style="font-style: italic">If you recieved Medi-Cal at home, any benefits paid while you were 55 years or older
    will be subject to Medi-Cal recovery,</span> or who (at any age) received benefits in a nursing home, unless there
    is a
    surviving spouse or a minor, blind or disabled child. If you received Medi-Cal benefits under the age of 55, then
    you do not have to repay
    the State for what it pays out for your medical care costs.</p>

<p>Estate recovery is how the state recovers its costs. IN 2012-2013, 8,533 estate recovery cases were opened to try to
    recoup some of the health care costs the State pays on behalf of Medi-Cal beneficiaries.</p>

<p>Estate recovery cases are opened when deceased Medi-Cal beneficiaries received services on or after their 55th
    birthday,
    and there was some indication of assets owned at the time of death.</p>

<p>California's definition of 'estate' includes such assests as living trusts (<span style="font-style: italic">as long
    as the beneficiary's name is still on the property at the time of death</span>), joint tenancies, tenancies in
    common and life
    estates, although claims onn the remainder interest in life estates are limited to those that were revocable.</p>

<p>Amount of recovery is limited to thte amount of benefits paid or to the value of the beneficiary's estate, whichever
    is less. The State can only collect up to the amount that is your part of the estate. The value of the estate is
    also
    reduced by the outstanding mortgages or debts on the home, burial costs, or other documented expenses.</p>

<p>California can also recover from annuities purchased by a beneficiary on or after September 1, 2004. The state <em>cannot</em>
    recover from IRAs, work-related pension funds or term life insurance policies, unless they name the state as the beneficiary or revert
    back to the estate.</p>

<p>If the estate is subject to probate or trust administration, the State has four months in which to file a claim.  If a claim is not filed within this time,
 it is forever barred.  By law, in non-probated estates, a claim must be filed within three years of receipt of the notice of death.</p>

<p>If you have more questions, consult an attorney.  Remember, planning is the first step in preparing for your future.</p>
