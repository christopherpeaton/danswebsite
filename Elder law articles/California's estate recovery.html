<h3 class="second-title">About California's Estate Recovery</h3>

<body>

<p>Federal regulations require states to pay the federal government a portion of the estate recovery collection amounts
    that are determined in accordance with the federal matching rate, known as the Federal Medicaid Assistance
    Percentage.</p>

<p>Under this provision, California would generally return 50% of the amounts collected. This does not include programs
    that have a higher matching rate - such as the ACA expansion population, which is entirely federally funded for the
    first three years of the expansion and declines to 90% by 2020.</p>

<p>This chart below shows how much California collected in revenue from estate recovery since 1993. California's share
    of any estate recovery revenue is placed in the State's Health Care Deposit Fund, which funds Medi-Cal, also known
    as Medicaid. Medi-Cal is a state program that provides health coverage to qualified, low-income California
    residents and seniors.</p>
