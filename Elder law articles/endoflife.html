<h3 class="second-title">Medicare and End-of-Life Counseling?</h3>

<p>Death and dying are very different. Death means that your loved ones are dealing with your passing. Dying means that
    you are dealing with your passing.</p>

<p>In 2016, Medicare will pay doctors and clinicians to counsel patients in their "advance care planning" - figure out
    options for care at the end of life, and plan for the kind of care they want.</p>

<p>By 2050, the projected population aged 65+ will be about 83.7 million, which is largely due to the baby boomers (who
    will be over 85-years-old by 2050), according to the U.S. Census Bureau report "An Aging Nation". That means there
    is a large population who will need different types and approaches to care.</p>

<p>According to the Institute of Medicine's report "Dying in America," most Americans have not been provided with care
    that is consistent with what they want - to dye at home - because people near the end of life often receive
    fragmented care tue to multiple transitions between health care settings and high rates of preventable
    hospitalizations.</p>

<p>The Institute notes some evidence suggests that people who receive palliative care and hospice patients may live
    longer than similarly ill patients who do not receive that type of care - in part because those similarly ill
    patients may not have the avenues of support available to make their wishes known to their doctors or loved ones.
    Patients receiving palliative care get specialized medical care with their serious medical care with their serious
    illnesses, providing them with relief from the pain and physical/mental stress resulting at the end of life.</p>

<p>Medicare is the largest insurer at the end of life, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, and about
    three-quarters of people who pass away in the United States are 65 and older. The Medicare end-of-life counseling
    available starting in 2016 is voluntary and can take place during annual wellness or even regular office visits.</p>

<p>End of life counseling was dropped from President Barak Obama's health care law due to an outcry by some Republicans
    that it would lead to 'death panels,' but Medicare's approach is to emphasize cooperative, compassionate, and
    affordable care between doctors, hospitals and other health care providers through the Accountable Care Organization
    (ACO).</p>

<p>The ACO model of care is about coordinating services to patients, emphasizing preventive services and paying
    attention to patients' transition between the hospital and home. Under this ACO model, clinical networks get part of
    their reimbursement from Medicare for meeting quality or cost targets, and is part of Medicare's attempt to support
    the delivery of better quality care at lower cost by doctors and hospitals.</p>

<p>This new development in Medicare highlights a shift in policy that is finally catching up with what is needed to
    compassionately and responsibly assist and our older population.</p>

<p>If you have more questions, consult an attorney. Remember, planning is the first step in preparing for your
    future.</p>
