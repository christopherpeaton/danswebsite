<h3 class="second-title">What is a Trademark?</h3>

<p>A trademark is a symbol, word or combination of both that is used to represent your company's product or service. If
    you use a mark to identify a service, that is called a service mark. Simply put, your mark is your identifying
    brand/image.</p>

<p>To keep your rights to a trademark, you must use it in commerce so that it distinguishes and identifies your company
    as the source of your product or service. The law defines "use in commerce" as follows:
<ul>
    <li>Use of your trademark in the ordinary course of business (i.e. your product/goods/services are sold or
        transported in commerce)
    </li>
    <li>Placement of your trademark on your product/goods or in the advertising of your services</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>The key to trademark is use. If you don't use it, you risk losing your rights to your mark even if you have
    registered it with the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO). If you have registered your mark, and have not used it in
    trade or enforced your trademark rights against infringers, then you may be liable to have your mark removed
    from the PTO register for non-use after a certain period of time (about 3-5 years).</p>

<p>An infringer is someone who uses your exact trademark or a similar mark without your authorization. There are two
    ways to protect your trademark from infringers: registration with the PTO, or use in commerce claiming common law
    protection.</p>

<p>Registration means that you get federal protection in the United States. That means your registered trademark can be
    used as a prima facie (accepted as correct on its face, until proved otherwise) evidence that you have sole and
    exclusive rights to use your mark. In an infringement action in court, you are automatically recognized as the owner
    of that mark by the law.</p>

<p>Common law protection means that you have rights to a mark if you are the first to use that mark in commerce.
    However, since you have not registered it, you have to prove that you have actually used your mark in commerce and
    were the first to use that mark. Be aware that your rights only extend to the geographic area that you can prove
    continuous use.</p>

<p>For example, if you have only used your mark in California, then you can only claim common law protection in
    California. Common law rights are state rights, and each state's laws may differ. Consult an attorney practicing
    intellectual property law in the state where you are using your mark, if you have any questions about your common
    law rights.</p>

<p>If you do not register your mark with the PTO, you risk someone else registering your mark and getting rights to use
    your mark in the United States. If you receive a cease and desist letter, then you need to prove first and actual
    use in your geographic area to maintain your legal right to continue to use your mark in that specific region, or,
    perhaps, where you may have reasonably been expected to expand.</p>

<p>Being a common law mark holder has its risks, but if you are a small company or have limited capital, it may be
    preferable to save on the costs of registering a mark with the PTO, which can cost more than $1,500 with attorney
    and filing fees. You may also not want to register your mark immediately because you amy still be deciding on the
    design of your mark. Once you have established your company and its mark, then it may be worth the cost to protect
    your image/brand/goodwill by federally registering your mark (if it has not already been taken by another).</p>

<p>If you have more questions, consult an attorney.  Remember, planning is the first stsep in preparing for your future.</p>
