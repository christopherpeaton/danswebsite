<h3 class="second-title">What is a Trademark?</h3>

<p>A trademark is a symbol, word or combination of both that is used to represent your company's product or service. If
    you use a mark to identify a service, that is called a service mark. Simply put, your mark is your identifying
    brand/image.</p>

<p>To keep your rights to a trademark, you must use it in commerce so that it distinguishes and identifies your company
    as the source of your product or service. The law defines "use in commerce" as follows:
<ul>
    <li>Use of your trademark in the ordinary course of business (i.e. your product/goods/services are sold or
        transported in commerce)
    </li>
    <li>Placement of your trademark on your product/goods or in the advertising of your services</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>The key to trademark is use. If you don't use it, you risk losing your rights to your mark even if you have
    registered it with the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO). If you have registered your mark, and have not used it in
    trade or enforced your trademark rights against infringeres, then you may be liable to have your mark removed
    from the PTO register for non-use after a certain period of time (about 3-5 years).</p>
